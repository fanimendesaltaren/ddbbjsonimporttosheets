This newsletter is designed for regular people, not AI experts or Ph.D. holders, and will report how AI is affecting our daily experiences.\n\nSide-stepping technical mumbo jumbo as far as possible, I examine the effects of AI on jobs and the workforce, and debate the ethics and moral dilemmas it represents. Rounding up will be a segment outlining the latest research in the field. \n\nToday, we are at an inflection stage where AI is concerned. I believe that because of its ubiquitous nature, all humans need to understand AI, its applications, and its implications. That‚Äôs why this bulletin is for the widest possible range of readers. The idea is to make this fascinating and rapidly evolving topic accessible to people from all walks of life in a language that humans, and not machines understand. ",
